# Submitting the result to the Aleo Oracle program

!!! danger "IMPORTANT"

    The backend **will not** submit your attestation result to the Aleo Oracle program!

The attestation results do not have to be used in an Aleo oracle-capable program or in Aleo in general. You
can choose to verify the reports in your web2 application and leave it at that.

If you do want to make the attestation available in Aleo, you have to submit it yourself to the published
Aleo Oracle program or to an oracle of your own making.

You can jump to the [Oracle program](./oracle_program.md) for a detailed explanation of how the Aleo Oracle program works.
